    Syntactically matching CQL examples using $VAR_NAME placeholders. Substitute variables
    with appropriate values before execution. Based on Taegis CQL docs in data/taegis-docs
    and field names from data/taegis-schemas/nids.proto.

    Variable bindings (field names from nids.proto): Use these as values when a variable
    is set to a field name (sort field, filter field, or fields selector). Identity/sensor:
    sensor_type, sensor_id, sensor_tenant, sensor_event_id, normalizer, host_id. Time:
    event_time_usec, ingest_time_usec. Addresses/ports: source_address, destination_address,
    source_port, destination_port. NIDS rule/alert: signature_id, generator_id, policy_id,
    message, classification, priority, action, blocked, impact_flag. Protocol/packet:
    protocol, icmp_type, icmp_code, ttl, flags, ip_len, tcp_len, dgm_len. User/app:
    source_username, destination_username, application_name. Other: direction, log_type,
    countermeasure_author, event_id, event_ref, vlan, mpls_label, original_data.
