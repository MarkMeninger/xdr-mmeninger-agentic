In the context of your homenet query and variable spec:

- **Homenet** is the **use case / scenario**: "traffic that originates from
  networks we treat as internal (or 'home') and goes to the rest of the
  internet." So "homenet" = outbound internal→external traffic you care
  about (e.g. for monitoring or blocking).

- **Internal CIDRs** are the **concrete network ranges** that define what
  "internal" (or "home") means in that scenario. They're the CIDR blocks
  you put in the source_address IN ... and destination_address !IN ...
  parts of the query. Examples from your spec:
  - **India**: $INDIA_INTERNAL_CIDRS (private ranges + India-specific CIDRs)
  - **Australia**: $AUS_INTERNAL_CIDRS
  - **Other regions**: $PRIVATE_CIDRS (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12,
    192.168.0.0/16)

So: **homenet** = what you're looking for (internal→external traffic);
**internal CIDRs** = the set of networks you're calling "internal" for
that homenet query. Different regions/sensors can use different internal
CIDR sets (India vs AUS vs private-only) while still all being "homenet"
queries.
